# Library Management System
A RESTful Library Management System built with Spring Boot, providing APIs to manage members, books, and borrowings. It allows for tracking borrowed books, identifying members with current borrowings, and more.

### Features
* Retrieve all members who have borrowed at least one book.
* Fetch all non-terminated members who currently have not borrowed any books.
* List all borrowings that occurred on a specified date.
* Find all books borrowed by a given member within a certain date range.
* Get a list of all available books (not currently borrowed).
